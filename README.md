# NgTasks

This repo was created for a interview project for Mobelux. The objective was to replicate the Google app "Task" (as much as possible) within a 8hr time window. And this was the result.

# Pre-Req

Ensure you have latest versions of Node and Npm installed as well as the Angular CLI
https://nodejs.org/en/

Developed with
Node -v: v8.12.0
NPM -v: 6.4.1
Angular CLI: 6.2.3

# Run Locally

Navigate to root of the project (ex. projects/ng-task) and follow these steps

2) Run ng serve
3) Go to http://localhost:4200/ on your browser
